Examples of Options Specialists with Potentially Minimal Portfolio Management Understanding:

Options Market Makers: Their primary goal is to provide liquidity in the options market by quoting both buy and sell prices. Their focus is on managing their inventory risk and profiting from the spread, not necessarily on constructing a diversified portfolio for a client. Â  
Volatility Arbitrage Traders: These traders seek to profit from discrepancies in the pricing of volatility across different options or related instruments. Their expertise lies in identifying and exploiting these arbitrage opportunities, which might not require a deep understanding of how these trades fit into a broader portfolio context.
Quantitative Options Strategists ("Quants"): They develop mathematical models for pricing and trading options. Their expertise is heavily focused on quantitative analysis and model building, which might be distinct from the qualitative and strategic aspects of portfolio management.
